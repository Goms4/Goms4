- 👋 Hi, I’m @Goms4 (a curious mind navigating the world of data).  
- 👀 I’m fascinated by patterns, numbers, and the stories they tell.  
- 🌱 Currently leveling up my skills in **Machine Learning**, **Big Data**, and **Cloud Computing**.  
- 💞️ Always open to teaming up on meaningful projects or building cool tools that simplify life.  
- 📫 Reach me at **gomschowdary@gmail.com** or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/boyalla-gomathi-077212279/).  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love visualizing concepts, whether it’s through data or just daydreaming scenarios.
